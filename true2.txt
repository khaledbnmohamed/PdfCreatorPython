Probability density has no physical meaning because it contains imaginary value.     	  
The complex conjugate of wave function should be a normalized function.
H (x,y,z)=E (x,y,z) is time-dependent Schrodinger equation.	   
Complex conjugate wave function is a different function.
Probability density is the square of probability description.
Time-independent Schrodinger equation depends on time. 
Complex conjugate wave function changes the wave function to imaginary function.
Wave function should be an orthonormalized function.
Probability description is the probability of finding a particle at certain position and certain time.
The electron is either a particle or a wave.
11-The total wave function could be separated to four functions.
?(x,y,z,t) is an imaginary function.
Quantum chemistry deals with the macroscopic particles.
State function should be solved mathematically.
