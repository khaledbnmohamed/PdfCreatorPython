The Eigen value of a particle in 2D-box is inversely proportional to the principal quantum number.
Hamiltonian operator for hydrogen atom is a Kinetic energy.
The divergence of a vector function is the gradient function.
The antibonding character increases the stability of molecules.
The difference between energy levels decreases with (n) for a particle in box.
H2-2 could exist as a molecule.
Time-independent Schrödinger equation is a function of position.
For a particle in box a nodless Eigen function has a minimum energy.
The electron level diagram represents the position and the momentum of a particle.
The substitution [?(nx)+ ?(ny) and E(nx) E(ny)] allow us to solve the two dimensional Schrödinger equation.
The wave function packet is real and particular to different types of particles.
A node is the best place to find an electron.
For a particle in a one-dimensional box of length L can be excited from the
n = 1 to the n = 2 state by light of frequency ?. If the box length is doubled, the frequency needed to produce the transition becomes ?/2.
Eigen function with quantum numbers n=3 and L=2, is a principal function.
Wave function is an Eigen function because of the effect of Eigen value.
The probability of finding a particle in 3D box at node at n=3 equals n-1.
H2 molecule has two types of overlap.
The number of overlaps is defined from the calculated bond strength.
Oppenheimer considers that the electron density is fixed point in space.
